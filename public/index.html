      <h5>Well, that is what Barlo said</h5>
      <p>Spotting and then foraging from straggling apple trees in Long Island and Queens is Mr. Longabardi’s passion, one he shares with his business partner, Benford Lepley, 32, who works as a photography retoucher and lives in Glen Cove. Together, they have picked apples near strip malls or abandoned monasteries, on small farms and in residential yards and, yes, by the side of the highway. Then they make wine and cider from the fruits of their travels in Mr. Longabardi’s garage in Roslyn.</p>
      <p>Their small but prestigious label, Floral Terranes, which was introduced in 2017, has been featured on menus of high-profile New York City restaurants like Gramercy Tavern, at least one Momofuku location and Olmsted. Many of their ciders have stories. Ida, which they released last year, is made from apples that were tossed prematurely onto the ground after torrential rains and winds from Hurricane Ida hit the area. Banbury Farm Cider, which they released in 2018, is made with apples from an old farm that was part of the lab in Cold Spring Harbor known for its role in the discovery of DNA’s structure.</p>
